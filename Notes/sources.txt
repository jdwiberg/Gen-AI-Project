“Monkey Selfie Copyright Dispute.” 2025. In Wikipedia. https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Monkey_selfie_copyright_dispute&oldid=1272300355.
    Copy right status of celfies taken by monkeys using equipment belonging to David J. slater
    Slater believed he had copy right and peta said the monkey does
    Wikimedia said that copy right is only holdable by humans
        Copyright office upheld that
        Though experts say that it should have been copyrightable
    Slater set up all the equipment for them to take it

    The copy right office detrmined the text, selection, coordination and arrangment are copyrightable
    Canceled the previos and reduced the scope of copyright
    There was no disclosure of generative ai work
    The office became aware of the use of generative ai and moved to cancel copy right
    Copy right requires two things
        the work needs to be independetly created by the author
        The work must possess sufficent creativity
    Works of authorship have unfiromly limited to the creations of human
    The office agreed that text was under copy right
    Midjourney does not interpret prompts as instructions
    Kashtanova claims to have engineered and refined the output
    The output cannot be predicted by users
    Due to this it can take a long time to generate the desired output
    The office does not contest that effort was put in
    But it is not creative effort
    Alongside that the edits done in photoshop as not creative enough for copyright protection

    There was some precedant that animals had writes given corpirations and trusts have rights.
    David slater set upa  camera to allow a crested macaque to take a series of selfies
    The court ruled that only the works created by humans were copyrightable
    PETA pointed out this case extended to artifically intelligent computers
    Ninth court argued that congreess and the president should have explicitatly stated animals have federal rights
    Animals can be protected under law but not given standing
    This case has similiarity to teh pbolems ai poses when looked at in comparission to Naruto the monkey David
    It can currently be inferned that unless congrees explicitalty states it AI can be authors
    U.S copy right office says works created by animals are not copyrightable
        Therefore they can be exploited for profit

    The current consensous is law covers that material generated wholly by AI is not copyrightable
        Though unclear how using AI as a tool effects generated content
        An increase in AI-generated outputs would undermine human creativity
    Technology has historically made it complicated. The lines of computer written and human authored has blurred.
    In 2022 copy right office confirmed that no human involvement blocks it from being copyrightable
    Depending on the system the result can be seeded or random
        Though these systems dont guarentee identical images
    It was determined that you need to provide substainal creative effort to be an author
    Assitive use of AI systems
        Ai has been used from films to code which have fallen under copy right
        There is a distinction of ai as a tool and ai as a stand in for human creativity
            Could be defined as when you are prompting a system
            But should only apply if you copy it instead of refrencing
        If a prompt can show enough creative conception of work they should be the author
        Ai systems are considered black boxes and its hard to know why the ai produces that output
        Ai systems generally transition from one medium into another medium
        It is more like curating a garden then painting
        If AIs followed prompts more closely then the office will reconsider
        Currently the office puts restrictions on work that is enhanced by an AI
        Edits to AI content should follow the same scrunity as edits to existing work
        If ai generated elements are contained in larger human works it doesnt effect the copyright
        Korea says only humans can be authors
        EU says creative process needs to be signifigant and falls under normal laws
        If AI was allowed to be copyrighted then the sheer volume would overwhelme humans
            This means authors would be unable to make a living and those that try will derease
        The existing legal doctrines are adequate toa nswer the question of copy right of AI
        
https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/25/why-are-creatives-fighting-uk-government-ai-proposals-on-copyright
    UK proposal allows ai companies to bypass copyright law for trianing
    Gives exceptions for text and data mining
    Gives creatives a way to opt out but there is no good right reservation process
    Requires AI developers to have transperancy
    AI models would be impossible to train without using copyright material
