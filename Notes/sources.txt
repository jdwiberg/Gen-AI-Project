    The current consensous is law covers that material generated wholly by AI is not copyrightable
        Though unclear how using AI as a tool effects generated content
        An increase in AI-generated outputs would undermine human creativity
    Technology has historically made it complicated. The lines of computer written and human authored has blurred.
    In 2022 copy right office confirmed that no human involvement blocks it from being copyrightable
    Depending on the system the result can be seeded or random
        Though these systems dont guarentee identical images
    It was determined that you need to provide substainal creative effort to be an author
    Assitive use of AI systems
        Ai has been used from films to code which have fallen under copy right
        There is a distinction of ai as a tool and ai as a stand in for human creativity
            Could be defined as when you are prompting a system
            But should only apply if you copy it instead of refrencing
        If a prompt can show enough creative conception of work they should be the author
        Ai systems are considered black boxes and its hard to know why the ai produces that output
        Ai systems generally transition from one medium into another medium
        It is more like curating a garden then painting
        If AIs followed prompts more closely then the office will reconsider
        Currently the office puts restrictions on work that is enhanced by an AI
        Edits to AI content should follow the same scrunity as edits to existing work
        If ai generated elements are contained in larger human works it doesnt effect the copyright
        Korea says only humans can be authors
        EU says creative process needs to be signifigant and falls under normal laws
        If AI was allowed to be copyrighted then the sheer volume would overwhelme humans
            This means authors would be unable to make a living and those that try will derease
        The existing legal doctrines are adequate toa nswer the question of copy right of AI
