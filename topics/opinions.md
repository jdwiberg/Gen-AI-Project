I don’t believe we will soon be seeing any AI Generated entering Le Louvre or Winning an Grammy purely by its own merit, but I do believe that in the near future we may see the end of large design teams creating detailed computer art for commercial purposes. Human designers could be replaced by a single hyper-capable Generative AI agent which speeds up the workflow and cuts costs to fractions of the original. An AI agent will soon be able to make art for smaller commercial purposes that is indistinguishable from art created by the human mind. 

Think of product labels, marketing materials, company logos, or art for websites. These small pieces of traditionally human creativity with which we interact daily could be replaced by the work of a sufficiently powerful AI without the average consumer being any the wiser. Even those most biased towards human art would likely fail to notice that the “Best Dad in the World” tag on their favorite coffee mug had been designed not by a human, but an AI agent. While some consumers may be hesitant to purchase products in which they know AI has had an impact, these biases will almost certainly fade if AI’s impact results in more cost effective products. In a world with more laissez-faire copyright restrictions pertaining to what AI can and can’t use to be trained, this race towards a replacement of the individual designer for an AI agent can only accelerate. 

That being said, some argue that a world with strict copyright restrictions could make the rise of AI-generated art financially infeasible, leading to an entirely different future than the one described. If lawmakers implement robust protections for artists and intellectual property, AI models trained on copyrighted works without explicit permission could face legal barriers that make their use impractical or unprofitable. Instead of a revolution where AI replaces human designers, we might see a world where AI is relegated to assisting rather than replacing creative professionals, ensuring that human artistry remains at the core of commercial works. Without free access to vast datasets of existing human-made artwork, AI art generators could also struggle to reach the level of nuance and originality needed to convincingly replicate human creativity. Large companies and design firms might abandon AI-generated art altogether due to the legal risks associated with using copyrighted material, favoring a return to traditional design teams. 

While this possible world is certainly not completely impossible, it seems to stray from historical precedent. I find it unlikely that companies will abandon a possibly groundbreaking new tool because the current set of laws is stacked against it. There are many historical examples supporting this point. To name a few, there were the anti-machinists who pushed against the implementation of industrial machines to prevent the loss of industrial work, the telegraph companies who attempted to lobby towards challenging the rise of the telephone, and regulations like “Red Flag Laws” which attempted to slow the rise of automobiles in favor of horse drawn carriages. As we know, these efforts to stop the spread of new technology were barely able to slow it down. Laws change, and attitudes change. As the world slowly drops its hostility toward machine generated creativity, even those who attacked it most viscerally may be lulled into an acceptance of its extreme usefulness. Copyright restrictions may delay this process by months, years, or even decades, but trying to spin back the wheel of progress is simply delaying the inevitable.

Personally, I don’t believe that governments will side with individual content creators in cases in which their content is used to train AI. Besides the fact tech companies involved in training and releasing AI models are some of the most powerful companies in the world (holding significant say in government through lobbying), the argument that training AI models on copyrighted content falls under fair/transformative use holds real weight. Individual content creators face a significant uphill battle in which they are outgunned in political and financial power, lacking in supporting legal doctrine, and swimming upstream against the tides of technological progress. The battle for copyright protection against AI is not over, but it may be smarter for content creators to begin to learn how to harness the power of AI to ride the wave than to be crushed under its world-changing force.

From my perspective, I think it is good that countries have almost universally decided that AI-generated content doesn’t fall under copyright. It is incredible that we, seemingly as a society, are siding with artists, large and small, to protect them and allow them to grow and flourish instead of allowing industry to demolish them.

But we go too far to block the training of generative AI on copyrighted content.  When we look at AI as an industry, it pulls advances from everywhere, such as attention models, which were designed for speech recognition but were later found to be highly effective in other areas. So, by blocking most opportunities for developing state-of-the-art methods, we will see a dramatic decrease in advancements. Without generative AI, we probably wouldn’t be on the precedent of cracking protein folding with AlphaFold. However, I think these models need some level of restriction on access as, currently, the barrier to entry to generate content for a normal person is nonexistent. 

So, despite being dubious ethically, allowing these models to train on copyrighted content is essential despite all of the complaints. This would allow us to find more breakthroughs in fields we have been stumped in and allow for stuff like 1nm transistors for CPUs, allowing for even more efficiency out of silicon. So, I don’t see a reason why we should stop it with legislation when it should focus more on how the outputs of these models are used instead of how we advance as a society.  I also think we will see these cases go towards saying that training falls under fair use as they are similar to real artists. They are looking at inspiration and using it to make their art, though when fair use laws were made, they were not designed for millions of images to be used as inspiration.
