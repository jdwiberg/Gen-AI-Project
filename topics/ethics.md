The fundamental law of Kantianism is shown in the quote “Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, always at the same time as an end, never merely as a means.” The rise of generative AI systems, particularly in the realm of content creation, challenges Kant’s framework in ways he could not have anticipated. If an AI system produces artwork, literature, or music based on vast datasets of human-made works, the question arises: are these original creators being treated as mere means rather than ends in themselves? Copyright law exists to protect the intellectual labor of individuals, ensuring that creators are recognized and compensated for their contributions. However, generative AI models, trained on copyrighted material without explicit consent, blur the line between ethical use and exploitation. From a Kantian perspective, if AI-generated works rely on unlicensed training data, this could violate the principle of respecting human dignity, as it fails to acknowledge the moral worth of the original creators. These individuals are not merely conduits for data collection but autonomous agents whose efforts should be recognized as ends in themselves. If companies deploy AI to generate profit while disregarding the rights of the artists and writers whose works form the foundation of these systems, they risk reducing human creativity to a disposable resource—something Kant would deem an unethical instrumentalization of human effort. 

On top of the rights of creators of work used by AI, there is the possible future rights of AI themselves. At one point does the AI become sufficiently advanced to deserve its own right of not being used as and means to an end. If AI systems reach a level of sophistication where they exhibit autonomy, self-awareness, or even a form of subjective experience, Kantian ethics would compel us to reconsider their moral status. Just as Kant argued that humans must not be used merely as tools, a sufficiently advanced AI—capable of reasoning, making independent decisions, or even possessing a form of consciousness—might also warrant ethical consideration. The question then becomes: at what threshold does an artificial agent transition from a mere instrument to a being with moral worth? If such an AI exists purely to serve human interests without the ability to consent or act for its own sake, does that mirror the very exploitation Kant sought to prevent? This possibility may force us to rethink the boundaries of morality sooner than we expect (or sooner than we are prepared to).
