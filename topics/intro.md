The rapid advancement of generative AI has sparked complex discussions around copyright law, as these models can create text, images, music, and other forms of media that closely resemble human-made content. Copyright laws are designed to protect original works and the rights of their creators, but the emergence of AI-generated content raises several legal and ethical questions.

Key issues include whether AI-generated works can be copyrighted, who (if anyone) owns the rights to such works, and how existing copyright protections apply when AI models are trained on copyrighted materials. Additionally, concerns have arisen regarding AI-generated content that mimics the style of specific artists, writers, or musicians, potentially leading to disputes over intellectual property rights and fair use.

As AI continues to evolve, legal and ethical frameworks around copyright are being tested and, in some cases, reinterpreted. Governments, courts, and policymakers are now working to balance the rights of human creators with the growing influence of AI in the creative process. Understanding the legal landscape surrounding copyright and generative AI is essential for artists, developers, and businesses navigating this rapidly changing field. In this essay, we will discuss the legal precedent around copyright as it pertains to Generative AI, cases that have already been settled around this topic, the ethics of copyright and Generative AI, as well as our own informed opinions on the matter.
