Copyright has historically been defined as the exclusive legal right, given to an originator or an assignee to print, publish, perform, film, or record literary, artistic, or musical material, and to authorize others to do the same. In the case of the United States, copyright requires ratification by the US Copyright Office. In some cases, it can be very obvious as to who owns the copyright of a certain material. For example, if you were to take a photo, paint a picture, write and sing an original song, it is simple to see that you own the copyright to that original material. Other commons cases are that of a company contracting an artist to develop artwork which makes the copyright based on their contract. These cases are also generally very black and white. Copyright in the world of Generative AI becomes much more gray. The intricacies of copyright law begin to come into view when more vague legal questions such as: "Who can hold copyright?" and "What is an original work?" have an effect on a case. 

For example, in July 2011, photographer David Slater set up camera equipment so that a monkey could take a selfie. Slater published these pictures and was even featured in Daily Mail for his work. The trouble started when Wikimedia decided to host the images on their website without permission from David Slater, an act which normally would violate copyright law.

The ensuing court case brought into question who owned this piece of content. David J. Slater obviously believed he owned it, as he did almost all of the creative work in producing the image. On the other hand, Wikimedia believed that copy right could only belong to the monkey as it took the picture itself. Since courts have ruled that only humans can hold copyright, this would render Davids claim of owernship on the image null and void and the image would become public domain. Some organizations, like PETA, even went as far as arguing that animals should be able to hold copyright. Experts at the time believed that David J. Slater had put in enough create effort for him to have copyright of the image. Yet this wasn't the verdict reached at the copy right office. They soon released an decisive letter that stated only humans could hold the copyright on an image, and since the image was taken by an ape the court decided that it fell into the public domain. Shortly after this case, appeals courts ruled against the animal rights organization PETA in a case in which they argued that animals could hold copyright.

A third piece of legal precedent that could factor into questions of copyright on Generative AI is Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co. (1991). This U.S. Supreme Court case dealt with the copyrightability of databases. Rural Telephone had created a directory of phone numbers, and Feist Publications used this data without permission for a competing directory. The Court ruled that facts, like phone numbers, are not copyrightable. However, the Court also determined that a creative arrangement or compilation of facts could be copyrighted. In this case, the Court found that Rural’s directory lacked sufficient creativity to warrant copyright protection, setting the precedent that copyright applies to the creative expression of data, not the data itself. This idea of copyright applying to the "creative expression of data" could be important when you consider that the output of an AI agent as we know them now is the compilation of "data" known as tokens expressed in a certain manner. It seems that AI output could be a considered to fall within this framework, possibly giving the rights of the content to the programmer of the AI.

Lastly, there are two very important doctrine's outlined in the U.S.'s policy on copyright. These are fair use and transformative use. In the U.S., copyright law includes the “fair use” doctrine, which allows certain uses of copyrighted works without permission from the copyright holder. Fair use includes uses such as criticism, commentary, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research. The use of copyrighted works for training LLMs could fall under fair use, depending on factors like the nature of the use, the amount of the work used, and its effect on the market value of the original work. Also, if the data used to train a model is transformed in a way that the model generates novel outputs (as opposed to directly reproducing copyrighted content), this could be argued as transformative, which may make the practice of training AI on copyrighted material even more likely to fall under fair use.

At the present moment, without new laws being passed, it seems as though the precedent may point towards the content generated by Generative AI agents belonging to the prompter. As AI agents are not human, they cannot themselves hold the copyright and since their output could be considered a creative expression of data by a computer program, the copyright would seem to fall into the hands of the programmer. In the case of LLM's, AI companies such as OpenAI, Meta, and Google would own the output under this logic. Currently, these companies assign ownership of the AI's output to the user. They allow their users to use the output of their AI for commercial and personal use. In the future, their will likely be more cases that will test the validity of this logic. In fact, a few cases around AI copyright have already reached decisions.
